Subject: [PATCH] Disable tty1 console when splash is present

When the splash parameter is passed to the kernel command line,
we want the splash screen to be displayed even after boot has
completed. By default, once boot is complete, tty1 is enabled
and we reach the login screen. Conversely, when there is no splash,
(or splash=false) and user wants to boot in text only mode, we
want to enable the getty@tty1.service file which will allow plymouth
to shift from tty0(splash screen) to tty1(login screen) after boot.
Hence, this service file is conditionally not executed if splash is
enabled on the command line.
