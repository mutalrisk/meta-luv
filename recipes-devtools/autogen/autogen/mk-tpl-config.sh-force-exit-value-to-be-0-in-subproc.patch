mk-tpl-config.sh: force exit value to be 0 in subprocess

The return value of statement list=`<subcommands>` is the exit value of the
subcommands. So if the subcommands fails, the compilation fails. This is obviously
not intended. In the normal case, we expect the grep command to fail as there should
be no 'noreturn' word in the libguile files.
