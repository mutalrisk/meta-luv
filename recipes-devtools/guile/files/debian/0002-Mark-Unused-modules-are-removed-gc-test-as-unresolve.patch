Subject: [PATCH] Mark "Unused modules are removed" gc test as unresolved.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [debian patch]

Signed-off-by: Nitin A Kamble <nitin.a.kamble@intel.com>

As per discussion with upstream, mark this test as unresolved since it
may produce false negatives, depending on the behavior/timing of the
garbage collector.
